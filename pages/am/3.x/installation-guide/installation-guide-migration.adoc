WARNING: If you plan to skip versions when you upgrade, ensure that you read the version-specific upgrade notes for each intermediate version. You may be required to perform manual actions as part of the upgrade.

WARNING: Be sure to run scripts on the correct database since `gravitee-am` is not always the default database! Check your db name by running `show dbs;`
